## Getting And Cleaning Data - Course Project - Introduction

This repo contains my results and scripts for the course project [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) ["Getting And Cleaning Data"](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-032) course.

The primary script `run_analysis.R`, is intended to perform the following:

1. Read data
2. Perform merging and transformations
3. Write output data to a CSV file inside `data/output` dir

The `CodeBook.md` explains this process in more detail.

## Run from command line

1. Clone this repo


2. Unpack the datset zip `https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip`

	   Unpack the dataset into directory: ~/Documents/Coursera/UCI HAR Dataset
	   E.g. So that xtrain.txt is located at: ~/Documents/Coursera/UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt
	   
3. Open and run the project with RStudio
